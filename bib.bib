@article{NeuromorphicPhotonics,
  abstract = {Research in photonic computing has flourished due to the proliferation of optoelectronic components on photonic integration platforms. Photonic integrated circuits have enabled ultrafast artificial neural networks, providing a framework for a new class of information processing machines. Algorithms running on such hardware have the potential to address the growing demand for machine learning and artificial intelligence in areas such as medical diagnosis, telecommunications, and high-performance and scientific computing. In parallel, the development of neuromorphic electronics has highlighted challenges in that domain, particularly related to processor latency. Neuromorphic photonics offers sub-nanosecond latencies, providing a complementary opportunity to extend the domain of artificial intelligence. Here, we review recent advances in integrated photonic neuromorphic systems, discuss current and future challenges, and outline the advances in science and technology needed to meet those challenges.},

@article{IntegratedPhotonics,
  abstract = {Integrated quantum photonics uses classical integrated photonic technologies and devices for quantum applications. As in classical photonics, chip-scale integration has become critical for scaling up and translating laboratory demonstrators to real-life technologies. Integrated quantum photonics efforts are centred around the development of quantum photonic integrated circuits, which can be monolithically, hybrid or heterogeneously integrated. In this Roadmap, we argue, through specific examples, for the value that integrated photonics brings to quantum technologies and discuss what applications may become possible in the future by overcoming the current roadblocks. We provide an overview of the research landscape and discuss the innovation and market potential. Our aim is to stimulate further research by outlining not only the scientific challenges of materials, devices and components associated with integrated photonics for quantum technologies but also those related to the development of the necessary manufacturing infrastructure and supply chains for delivering these technologies to the market.},

@article{Variational,
  abstract = {Applications such as simulating complicated quantum systems or solving large-scale linear algebra problems are very challenging for classical computers, owing to the extremely high computational cost. Quantum computers promise a solution, although fault-tolerant quantum computers will probably not be available in the near future. Current quantum devices have serious constraints, including limited numbers of qubits and noise processes that limit circuit depth. Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), which use a classical optimizer to train a parameterized quantum circuit, have emerged as a leading strategy to address these constraints. VQAs have now been proposed for essentially all applications that researchers have envisaged for quantum computers, and they appear to be the best hope for obtaining quantum advantage. Nevertheless, challenges remain, including the trainability, accuracy and efficiency of VQAs. Here we overview the field of VQAs, discuss strategies to overcome their challenges and highlight the exciting prospects for using them to obtain quantum advantage.},

@article{Combinatorial,
  abstract = {It is unclear to what extent quantum algorithms can outperform classical algorithms for problems of combinatorial optimization. In this work, by resorting to computational learning theory and cryptographic notions, we give a fully constructive proof that quantum computers feature a super-polynomial advantage over classical computers in approximating combinatorial optimization problems. Specifically, by building on seminal work by Kearns and Valiant, we provide special instances that are hard for classical computers to approximate up to polynomial factors. Simultaneously, we give a quantum algorithm that can efficiently approximate the optimal solution within a polynomial factor. The quantum advantage in this work is ultimately borrowed from Shor's quantum algorithm for factoring. We introduce an explicit and comprehensive end-to-end construction for the advantage bearing instances. For these instances, quantum computers have, in principle, the power to approximate combinatorial optimization solutions beyond the reach of classical efficient algorithms. A reduction that shows in what way one can expect quantum advantages in combinatorial optimization is presented.},

@article{KagomeIce,
  abstract = {Topological phases of spin liquids with constrained disorder can host a kinetics of fractionalized excitations. However, spin-liquid phases with distinct kinetic regimes have proven difficult to observe experimentally. Here we present a realization of kagome spin ice in the superconducting qubits of a quantum annealer, and use it to demonstrate a field-induced kinetic crossover between spin-liquid phases. Employing fine control over local magnetic fields, we show evidence of both the Ice-I phase and an unconventional field-induced Ice-II phase. In the latter, a charge-ordered yet spin-disordered topological phase, the kinetics proceeds via pair creation and annihilation of strongly correlated, charge conserving, fractionalized excitations. As these kinetic regimes have resisted characterization in other artificial spin ice realizations, our results demonstrate the utility of quantum-driven kinetics in advancing the study of topological phases of spin liquids.},

@article{MottInsulator,
  abstract = {For a system at a temperature of absolute zero, all thermal fluctuations are frozen out, while quantum fluctuations prevail. These microscopic quantum fluctuations can induce a macroscopic phase transition in the ground state of a many-body system when the relative strength of two competing energy terms is varied across a critical value. Here we observe such a quantum phase transition in a Bose--Einstein condensate with repulsive interactions, held in a three-dimensional optical lattice potential. As the potential depth of the lattice is increased, a transition is observed from a superfluid to a Mott insulator phase. In the superfluid phase, each atom is spread out over the entire lattice, with long-range phase coherence. But in the insulating phase, exact numbers of atoms are localized at individual lattice sites, with no phase coherence across the lattice; this phase is characterized by a gap in the excitation spectrum. We can induce reversible changes between the two ground states of the system.},

@article{graphene_transistors,
  abstract = {Graphene has changed from being the exclusive domain of condensed-matter physicists to being explored by those in the electron-device community. In particular, graphene-based transistors have developed rapidly and are now considered an option for post-silicon electronics. However, many details about the potential performance of graphene transistors in real applications remain unclear. Here I review the properties of graphene that are relevant to electron devices, discuss the trade-offs among these properties and examine their effects on the performance of graphene transistors in both logic and radiofrequency applications. I conclude that the excellent mobility of graphene may not, as is often assumed, be its most compelling feature from a device perspective. Rather, it may be the possibility of making devices with channels that are extremely thin that will allow graphene field-effect transistors to be scaled to shorter channel lengths and higher speeds without encountering the adverse short-channel effects that restrict the performance of existing devices. Outstanding challenges for graphene transistors include opening a sizeable and well-defined bandgap in graphene, making large-area graphene transistors that operate in the current-saturation regime and fabricating graphene nanoribbons with well-defined widths and clean edges.},

@article{moire,
  abstract = {Contemporary quantum materials research is guided by themes of topology and electronic correlations. A confluence of these two themes is engineered in moir{\'e}materials, an emerging class of highly tunable, strongly correlated 2D materials designed by the rotational or lattice misalignment of atomically thin crystals. In moir{\'e}materials, dominant Coulomb interactions among electrons give rise to collective electronic phases, often with robust topological properties. Identifying the mechanisms responsible for these exotic phases is fundamental to our understanding of strongly interacting quantum systems and to our ability to engineer new material properties for potential future technological applications. In this Review, we highlight the contributions of local spectroscopic, thermodynamic and electromagnetic probes to the budding field of moir{\'e}materials research. These techniques have not only identified many of the underlying mechanisms of the correlated insulators, generalized Wigner crystals, unconventional superconductors, moir{\'e}ferroelectrics and topological orbital ferromagnets found in moir{\'e}materials, but have also uncovered fragile quantum phases that have evaded spatially averaged global probes. Furthermore, we highlight recently developed local probe techniques, including local charge sensing and quantum interference probes, that have uncovered new physical observables in moir{\'e}materials.},

@article{spintronics_topo,
  abstract = {Topological insulators (TIs) are emerging materials for next-generation low-power nanoelectronic and spintronic device applications. TIs possess non-trivial spin-momentum locking features in the topological surface states in addition to the spin-Hall effect (SHE), and Rashba states due to high spin-orbit coupling (SOC) properties. These phenomena are vital for observing the charge-spin conversion (CSC) processes for spin-based memory, logic and quantum technologies. Although CSC has been observed in TIs by potentiometric measurements, reliable nonlocal detection has so far been limited to cryogenic temperatures up to T = 15 K. Here, we report nonlocal detection of CSC and its inverse effect in the TI compound Bi1.5Sb0.5Te1.7Se1.3 at room temperature using a van der Waals heterostructure with a graphene spin-valve device. The lateral nonlocal device design with graphene allows observation of both spin-switch and Hanle spin precession signals for generation, injection and detection of spin currents by the TI. Detailed bias- and gate-dependent measurements in different geometries prove the robustness of the CSC effects in the TI. These findings demonstrate the possibility of using topological materials to make all-electrical room-temperature spintronic devices.},

Such `entangled'states explicitly demonstrate the non-local character of quantum theory1, having potential applications in high-precision spectroscopy2, quantum communication, cryptography and computation3. In general, the more particles that can be entangled, the more clearly nonclassical effects are exhibited4,5---and the more useful the states are for quantum applications. Here we implement a recently proposed entanglement technique6 to generate entangled states of two and four trapped ions. Coupling between the ions is provided through their collective motional degrees of freedom, but actual motional excitation is minimized. Entanglement is achieved using a single laser pulse, and the method can in principle be applied to any number of ions.},

abstract = {ARC 3.0 is a modular, object-oriented Python library combining data and algorithms to enable the calculation of a range of properties of alkali and divalent atoms. Building on the initial version of the ARC library (Šibalić et al., 2017), which focused on Rydberg states of alkali atoms, this major upgrade introduces support for divalent atoms. It also adds new methods for working with atom–surface interactions, for modelling ultracold atoms in optical lattices and for calculating valence electron wave functions and dynamic polarisabilities. Such calculations have applications in a variety of fields, e.g., in the quantum simulation of many-body physics, in atom-based sensing of DC and AC fields (including in microwave and THz metrology) and in the development of quantum gate protocols. ARC 3.0 comes with an extensive documentation including numerous examples. Its modular structure facilitates its application to a wide range of problems in atom-based quantum technologies.
Program summary
Program Title: ARC 3.0 CPC Library link to program files: https://doi.org/10.17632/c4z4n2cdf7.1 Licencing provisions: BSD-3-Clause Programming language: Python External Routines: NumPy [1], SciPy [1], Matplotlib [2], SymPy [3], LmFit [4] Nature of problem: The calculation of atomic properties of alkali and divalent atoms including energies, Stark shifts and dipole–dipole interaction strengths using matrix elements evaluated through a variety of means. Solution method: Dipole matrix elements are calculated using an analytical semi-classical approximation or wave functions obtained by numerical integration of the radial Schrödinger equation for a one-electron model potential. Interaction energies and shifts due to external fields are calculated using second order degenerate perturbation theory or exact diagonalisation of the interaction Hamiltonian, yielding results valid even at large external fields or small interatomic separation. Additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: External electric and magnetic field must be parallel to the quantisation axis. The accuracy of short range (≲1μm) atom - atom interaction potentials is limited by the truncation of the basis. Only weak magnetic fields are supported as only linear Zeeman shifts are taken into account. Calculations for divalent atoms use a single-electron approximation and calculation of their wave functions is not supported. References [1] T.E. Oliphant, Comput. Sci.

Neutral-atom arrays have recently emerged as a promising quantum computing platform, featuring coherent control over hundreds of qubits2,3 and any-to-any gate connectivity in a flexible, dynamically reconfigurable architecture4. The main outstanding challenge has been to reduce errors in entangling operations mediated through Rydberg interactions5. Here we report the realization of two-qubit entangling gates with 99.5{\%} fidelity on up to 60 atoms in parallel, surpassing the surface-code threshold for error correction6,7. Our method uses fast, single-pulse gates based on optimal control8, atomic dark states to reduce scattering9 and improvements to Rydberg excitation and atom cooling. We benchmark fidelity using several methods based on repeated gate applications10,11, characterize the physical error sources and outline future improvements. Finally, we generalize our method to design entangling gates involving a higher number of qubits, which we demonstrate by realizing low-error three-qubit gates12,13. By enabling high-fidelity operation in a scalable, highly connected system, these advances lay the groundwork for large-scale implementation of quantum algorithms14, error-corrected circuits7 and digital simulations15.},

	abstract = {Enhancing light--matter coupling at the level of single quanta is essential for numerous applications in quantum science. The cooperative optical response of subwavelength atomic arrays has been found to open new pathways for such strong light--matter couplings, while simultaneously offering access to multiple spatial modes of the light field. Efficient single-mode free-space coupling to such arrays has been reported, but spatial control over the modes of outgoing light fields has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate such spatial control over the optical response of an atomically thin mirror formed by a subwavelength array of atoms in free space using a single controlled ancilla atom excited to a Rydberg state. The switching behaviour is controlled by the admixture of a small Rydberg fraction to the atomic mirror, and consequently strong dipolar Rydberg interactions with the ancilla. Driving Rabi oscillations on the ancilla atom, we demonstrate coherent control of the transmission and reflection of the array. These results represent a step towards the realization of quantum coherent metasurfaces, the demonstration of controlled atom--photon entanglement and deterministic engineering of quantum states of light.},

	abstract = {Rydberg atoms, with their enormous electronic orbitals, exhibit dipole--dipole interactions reaching the gigahertz range at a distance of a micrometre, making them a prominent contender for realizing ultrafast quantum operations. However, such strong interactions between two single atoms have so far never been harnessed due to the stringent requirements on the fluctuation of the atom positions and the necessary excitation strength. Here we introduce novel techniques to explore this regime. First, we trap and cool atoms to the motional quantum ground state of holographic optical tweezers, which allows control of the inter-atomic distance down to 1.5 μm with a quantum-limited precision of 30 nm. We then use ultrashort laser pulses to excite a pair of these nearby atoms to a Rydberg state simultaneously, far beyond the Rydberg blockade regime, and perform Ramsey interferometry with attosecond precision. This allows us to induce and track an ultrafast interaction-driven energy exchange completed on nanosecond timescales---two orders of magnitude faster than in any other Rydberg experiments in the tweezers platform so far. This ultrafast coherent dynamics gives rise to a conditional phase, which is the key resource for a quantum gate, opening the path for quantum simulation and computation operating at the speed limit set by dipole--dipole interactions with this ultrafast Rydberg platform.},

@article{Bluvstein:2024aa,
	abstract = {Suppressing errors is the central challenge for useful quantum computing1, requiring quantum error correction (QEC)2--6 for large-scale processing. However, the overhead in the realization of error-corrected `logical'qubits, in which information is encoded across many physical qubits for redundancy2--4, poses substantial challenges to large-scale logical quantum computing. Here we report the realization of a programmable quantum processor based on encoded logical qubits operating with up to 280 physical qubits. Using logical-level control and a zoned architecture in reconfigurable neutral-atom arrays7, our system combines high two-qubit gate fidelities8, arbitrary connectivity7,9, as well as fully programmable single-qubit rotations and mid-circuit readout10--15. Operating this logical processor with various types of encoding, we demonstrate improvement of a two-qubit logic gate by scaling surface-code6 distance from d = 3 to d = 7, preparation of colour-code qubits with break-even fidelities5, fault-tolerant creation of logical Greenberger--Horne--Zeilinger (GHZ) states and feedforward entanglement teleportation, as well as operation of 40 colour-code qubits. Finally, using 3D {$[$}{$[$}8,3,2{$]$}{$]$} code blocks16,17, we realize computationally complex sampling circuits18 with up to 48 logical qubits entangled with hypercube connectivity19 with 228 logical two-qubit gates and 48 logical CCZ gates20. We find that this logical encoding substantially improves algorithmic performance with error detection, outperforming physical-qubit fidelities at both cross-entropy benchmarking and quantum simulations of fast scrambling21,22. These results herald the advent of early error-corrected quantum computation and chart a path towards large-scale logical processors.},

	abstract = {Quantum computers can now run interesting programs, but each processor's capability---the set of programs that it can run successfully---is limited by hardware errors. These errors can be complicated, making it difficult to accurately predict a processor's capability. Benchmarks can be used to measure capability directly, but current benchmarks have limited flexibility and scale poorly to many-qubit processors. We show how to construct scalable, efficiently verifiable benchmarks based on any program by using a technique that we call circuit mirroring. With it, we construct two flexible, scalable volumetric benchmarks based on randomized and periodically ordered programs. We use these benchmarks to map out the capabilities of twelve publicly available processors, and to measure the impact of program structure on each one. We find that standard error metrics are poor predictors of whether a program will run successfully on today's hardware, and that current processors vary widely in their sensitivity to program structure.},

Second, we experimentally show that for creating trapping potentials free of fringing artifacts it is important to go beyond the Fourier approximation in modelling light propagation. To this end, we incorporate full Helmholtz propagation into our calculations.},

	abstract = {Composite pulses which possess rectangular excitation or inversion profiles with respect to the radiofrequency field strength are derived for use in NMR spectroscopy. The basic sequences are designed using arguments based on symmetry and simple average Hamiltonian theory. The on-resonance performance can subsequently be improved to any degree using an iterative expansion scheme. Possible applications of these rectangular-profile composite pulses include their use in spatial localization' experiments and as models for deriving broadband multiple-pulse techniques.},

The broadband pulses excite transverse magnetization with nearly constant amplitude and phase over a very wide range of values of the radiofrequency field strength. These composite pulses are therefore suitable models for designing improved broadband multiple-pulse techniques. Broadband INEPT and Jeener-Broekaert experiments are demonstrated.},
