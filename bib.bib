abstract = {ARC 3.0 is a modular, object-oriented Python library combining data and algorithms to enable the calculation of a range of properties of alkali and divalent atoms. Building on the initial version of the ARC library (Šibalić et al., 2017), which focused on Rydberg states of alkali atoms, this major upgrade introduces support for divalent atoms. It also adds new methods for working with atom–surface interactions, for modelling ultracold atoms in optical lattices and for calculating valence electron wave functions and dynamic polarisabilities. Such calculations have applications in a variety of fields, e.g., in the quantum simulation of many-body physics, in atom-based sensing of DC and AC fields (including in microwave and THz metrology) and in the development of quantum gate protocols. ARC 3.0 comes with an extensive documentation including numerous examples. Its modular structure facilitates its application to a wide range of problems in atom-based quantum technologies.
Program summary
Program Title: ARC 3.0 CPC Library link to program files: https://doi.org/10.17632/c4z4n2cdf7.1 Licencing provisions: BSD-3-Clause Programming language: Python External Routines: NumPy [1], SciPy [1], Matplotlib [2], SymPy [3], LmFit [4] Nature of problem: The calculation of atomic properties of alkali and divalent atoms including energies, Stark shifts and dipole–dipole interaction strengths using matrix elements evaluated through a variety of means. Solution method: Dipole matrix elements are calculated using an analytical semi-classical approximation or wave functions obtained by numerical integration of the radial Schrödinger equation for a one-electron model potential. Interaction energies and shifts due to external fields are calculated using second order degenerate perturbation theory or exact diagonalisation of the interaction Hamiltonian, yielding results valid even at large external fields or small interatomic separation. Additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: External electric and magnetic field must be parallel to the quantisation axis. The accuracy of short range (≲1μm) atom - atom interaction potentials is limited by the truncation of the basis. Only weak magnetic fields are supported as only linear Zeeman shifts are taken into account. Calculations for divalent atoms use a single-electron approximation and calculation of their wave functions is not supported. References [1] T.E. Oliphant, Comput. Sci.

@article{Evered:2023aa,
	abstract = {The ability to perform entangling quantum operations with low error rates in a scalable fashion is a central element of useful quantum information processing1. Neutral-atom arrays have recently emerged as a promising quantum computing platform, featuring coherent control over hundreds of qubits2,3 and any-to-any gate connectivity in a flexible, dynamically reconfigurable architecture4. The main outstanding challenge has been to reduce errors in entangling operations mediated through Rydberg interactions5. Here we report the realization of two-qubit entangling gates with 99.5{\%} fidelity on up to 60 atoms in parallel, surpassing the surface-code threshold for error correction6,7. Our method uses fast, single-pulse gates based on optimal control8, atomic dark states to reduce scattering9 and improvements to Rydberg excitation and atom cooling. We benchmark fidelity using several methods based on repeated gate applications10,11, characterize the physical error sources and outline future improvements. Finally, we generalize our method to design entangling gates involving a higher number of qubits, which we demonstrate by realizing low-error three-qubit gates12,13. By enabling high-fidelity operation in a scalable, highly connected system, these advances lay the groundwork for large-scale implementation of quantum algorithms14, error-corrected circuits7 and digital simulations15.},

@article{Srakaew:2023aa,
	abstract = {Enhancing light--matter coupling at the level of single quanta is essential for numerous applications in quantum science. The cooperative optical response of subwavelength atomic arrays has been found to open new pathways for such strong light--matter couplings, while simultaneously offering access to multiple spatial modes of the light field. Efficient single-mode free-space coupling to such arrays has been reported, but spatial control over the modes of outgoing light fields has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate such spatial control over the optical response of an atomically thin mirror formed by a subwavelength array of atoms in free space using a single controlled ancilla atom excited to a Rydberg state. The switching behaviour is controlled by the admixture of a small Rydberg fraction to the atomic mirror, and consequently strong dipolar Rydberg interactions with the ancilla. Driving Rabi oscillations on the ancilla atom, we demonstrate coherent control of the transmission and reflection of the array. These results represent a step towards the realization of quantum coherent metasurfaces, the demonstration of controlled atom--photon entanglement and deterministic engineering of quantum states of light.},

@article{Chew:2022aa,
	abstract = {Rydberg atoms, with their enormous electronic orbitals, exhibit dipole--dipole interactions reaching the gigahertz range at a distance of a micrometre, making them a prominent contender for realizing ultrafast quantum operations. However, such strong interactions between two single atoms have so far never been harnessed due to the stringent requirements on the fluctuation of the atom positions and the necessary excitation strength. Here we introduce novel techniques to explore this regime. First, we trap and cool atoms to the motional quantum ground state of holographic optical tweezers, which allows control of the inter-atomic distance down to 1.5 μm with a quantum-limited precision of 30 nm. We then use ultrashort laser pulses to excite a pair of these nearby atoms to a Rydberg state simultaneously, far beyond the Rydberg blockade regime, and perform Ramsey interferometry with attosecond precision. This allows us to induce and track an ultrafast interaction-driven energy exchange completed on nanosecond timescales---two orders of magnitude faster than in any other Rydberg experiments in the tweezers platform so far. This ultrafast coherent dynamics gives rise to a conditional phase, which is the key resource for a quantum gate, opening the path for quantum simulation and computation operating at the speed limit set by dipole--dipole interactions with this ultrafast Rydberg platform.},

	abstract = {Suppressing errors is the central challenge for useful quantum computing1, requiring quantum error correction (QEC)2--6 for large-scale processing. However, the overhead in the realization of error-corrected `logical'qubits, in which information is encoded across many physical qubits for redundancy2--4, poses substantial challenges to large-scale logical quantum computing. Here we report the realization of a programmable quantum processor based on encoded logical qubits operating with up to 280 physical qubits. Using logical-level control and a zoned architecture in reconfigurable neutral-atom arrays7, our system combines high two-qubit gate fidelities8, arbitrary connectivity7,9, as well as fully programmable single-qubit rotations and mid-circuit readout10--15. Operating this logical processor with various types of encoding, we demonstrate improvement of a two-qubit logic gate by scaling surface-code6 distance from d = 3 to d = 7, preparation of colour-code qubits with break-even fidelities5, fault-tolerant creation of logical Greenberger--Horne--Zeilinger (GHZ) states and feedforward entanglement teleportation, as well as operation of 40 colour-code qubits. Finally, using 3D {$[$}{$[$}8,3,2{$]$}{$]$} code blocks16,17, we realize computationally complex sampling circuits18 with up to 48 logical qubits entangled with hypercube connectivity19 with 228 logical two-qubit gates and 48 logical CCZ gates20. We find that this logical encoding substantially improves algorithmic performance with error detection, outperforming physical-qubit fidelities at both cross-entropy benchmarking and quantum simulations of fast scrambling21,22. These results herald the advent of early error-corrected quantum computation and chart a path towards large-scale logical processors.},

	abstract = {Quantum computers can now run interesting programs, but each processor's capability---the set of programs that it can run successfully---is limited by hardware errors. These errors can be complicated, making it difficult to accurately predict a processor's capability. Benchmarks can be used to measure capability directly, but current benchmarks have limited flexibility and scale poorly to many-qubit processors. We show how to construct scalable, efficiently verifiable benchmarks based on any program by using a technique that we call circuit mirroring. With it, we construct two flexible, scalable volumetric benchmarks based on randomized and periodically ordered programs. We use these benchmarks to map out the capabilities of twelve publicly available processors, and to measure the impact of program structure on each one. We find that standard error metrics are poor predictors of whether a program will run successfully on today's hardware, and that current processors vary widely in their sensitivity to program structure.},

This becomes possible through large aperture magnifying optics that project microscopic light patterns with diffraction limited performance. We use programmable amplitude holograms generated on a digital micromirror device to create arbitrary microscopic beam shapes with full phase and amplitude control. The system self-corrects for aberrations of up to several \&\#x003BB; and reduces them to \&\#x003BB;/50, leading to light patterns with a precision on the 10\&\#x02212;4 level. We demonstrate aberration-compensated beam shaping in an optical lattice experiment and perform single-site addressing in a quantum gas microscope for 87Rb.},

Our method builds on the best previously available algorithm, MRAF and improves on it in two ways. First, it allows for creation of holographic atom traps with a well defined background potential. Second, we experimentally show that for creating trapping potentials free of fringing artifacts it is important to go beyond the Fourier approximation in modelling light propagation. To this end, we incorporate full Helmholtz propagation into our calculations.},
