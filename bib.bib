@article{Bluvstein:2024aa,
	abstract = {Suppressing errors is the central challenge for useful quantum computing1, requiring quantum error correction (QEC)2--6 for large-scale processing. However, the overhead in the realization of error-corrected `logical'qubits, in which information is encoded across many physical qubits for redundancy2--4, poses substantial challenges to large-scale logical quantum computing. Here we report the realization of a programmable quantum processor based on encoded logical qubits operating with up to 280 physical qubits. Using logical-level control and a zoned architecture in reconfigurable neutral-atom arrays7, our system combines high two-qubit gate fidelities8, arbitrary connectivity7,9, as well as fully programmable single-qubit rotations and mid-circuit readout10--15. Operating this logical processor with various types of encoding, we demonstrate improvement of a two-qubit logic gate by scaling surface-code6 distance from d = 3 to d = 7, preparation of colour-code qubits with break-even fidelities5, fault-tolerant creation of logical Greenberger--Horne--Zeilinger (GHZ) states and feedforward entanglement teleportation, as well as operation of 40 colour-code qubits. Finally, using 3D {$[$}{$[$}8,3,2{$]$}{$]$} code blocks16,17, we realize computationally complex sampling circuits18 with up to 48 logical qubits entangled with hypercube connectivity19 with 228 logical two-qubit gates and 48 logical CCZ gates20. We find that this logical encoding substantially improves algorithmic performance with error detection, outperforming physical-qubit fidelities at both cross-entropy benchmarking and quantum simulations of fast scrambling21,22. These results herald the advent of early error-corrected quantum computation and chart a path towards large-scale logical processors.},

@article{Proctor:2022aa,
	abstract = {Quantum computers can now run interesting programs, but each processor's capability---the set of programs that it can run successfully---is limited by hardware errors. These errors can be complicated, making it difficult to accurately predict a processor's capability. Benchmarks can be used to measure capability directly, but current benchmarks have limited flexibility and scale poorly to many-qubit processors. We show how to construct scalable, efficiently verifiable benchmarks based on any program by using a technique that we call circuit mirroring. With it, we construct two flexible, scalable volumetric benchmarks based on randomized and periodically ordered programs. We use these benchmarks to map out the capabilities of twelve publicly available processors, and to measure the impact of program structure on each one. We find that standard error metrics are poor predictors of whether a program will run successfully on today's hardware, and that current processors vary widely in their sensitivity to program structure.},

This becomes possible through large aperture magnifying optics that project microscopic light patterns with diffraction limited performance. We use programmable amplitude holograms generated on a digital micromirror device to create arbitrary microscopic beam shapes with full phase and amplitude control. The system self-corrects for aberrations of up to several \&\#x003BB; and reduces them to \&\#x003BB;/50, leading to light patterns with a precision on the 10\&\#x02212;4 level. We demonstrate aberration-compensated beam shaping in an optical lattice experiment and perform single-site addressing in a quantum gas microscope for 87Rb.},

Second, we experimentally show that for creating trapping potentials free of fringing artifacts it is important to go beyond the Fourier approximation in modelling light propagation. To this end, we incorporate full Helmholtz propagation into our calculations.},

	abstract = {Novel broadband and narrowband composite 90$\,^{\circ}$ pulses are derived for use in NMR spectroscopy. The broadband pulses excite transverse magnetization with nearly constant amplitude and phase over a very wide range of values of the radiofrequency field strength. These composite pulses are therefore suitable models for designing improved broadband multiple-pulse techniques. Broadband INEPT and Jeener-Broekaert experiments are demonstrated.},
